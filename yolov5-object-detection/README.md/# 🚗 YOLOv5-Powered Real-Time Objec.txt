# 🚗 YOLOv5-Powered Real-Time Object Detection Platform

A real-time object detection system using **YOLOv5**, deployed on **AWS EC2**, built to detect vehicles with high accuracy across different conditions.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a computer vision pipeline using YOLOv5 to detect objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) in real-time video feeds. It was deployed on a cloud-based EC2 instance for scalability and accessibility.

## 🎯 Key Features
- 🔍 High-accuracy object detection (90%+ precision)
- ⚡ Real-time inference on video streams
- ☁️ Deployed on AWS EC2 with OpenCV-based streaming
- 🛠️ Easy model retraining for custom object classes

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- YOLOv5 (PyTorch)
- OpenCV
- AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)
- Flask (optional for API serving)

## 📊 Results
- Achieved **90%+ detection accuracy** on test videos
- Real-time processing speed ~20 FPS on GPU-backed EC2 instance

## 🧪 How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolov5-object-detection.git
